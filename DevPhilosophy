Summary: On me and the internet... Solving Problems
---------------------------------------------------
I solve problems by connecting the dots. I identify avialable resources, potential challenges, and most importantly, EXACTLY what the PROBLEM that I am solving is. When you connect these dots, solutions will often reveal themselves. This process is optimized when one can truly believe in the solution and the problem (i.e. the Poduct).

The internet gives us a creative platform to develop these products in a highly efficient manner. Having invested the last 6 months into learning a collection of cutting-edge tools, I am seeking out an oppurtunity to apply my knowledge-base and contribute to a product team solving an ambitous problem.

-> Push the limits of my own capability 

x Connect the Dots
x Use/Believe your Product
x The Internet Connects People, Places & Things (& more!)

Closing Thought:
----------------
Many People Believe that programming languages/computers is a really difficult job, and because many of the software-applicatiins today do some very complicated things, it follows that programmers have a complicated job. I believe the truth is, however, to the contrary.

 Through the use of learnable tools, programming languages provide a very simple environment to build these complex programs in. Granted, a certain level of logic is involved, but I truly believe anyone with a legitimate hight school diploma has the ability to learn to code.
